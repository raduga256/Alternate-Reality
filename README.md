# Alternate Reality

-------

What if I had never left New York? What are some essays and poems (and emails) I would have written if I had stayed there after December 2018? 

## Motivation

-------

Ever since I came back from New York City, I have been heartbroken as I wondered of all the opportunities and experiences I missed.
I also realized how much I missed the tedious nightly english homework, science research papers, and history essays I used to write. Now that I
look back on those tasks, I realize that they are the reason why my english writing skills are highly developed. But alas, my university in India
does not require me to critically analyze novel texts for rhetorical and literary devices anymore. Of course, I can do these things by myself,
but to a certain extent.

However, one problem in this scenario that I can solve, is the part where I would not get to reflect on my written pieces anymore.
