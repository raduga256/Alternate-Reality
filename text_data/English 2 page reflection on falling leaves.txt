The author of “Falling Leaves” paints a descriptive and emotional character of the protagonist, Adeline Yen Mah. From the prologue to the third chapter, the author describes how the Yen family became so famous and successful. By giving detailed descriptions of her family members, she reflects the origin of her own values. From the beginning, Yen Mah talks about the disparity between men and women in China. She gives an example to show that when she says, “A wife was often treated as an indentured servant in her husband’s household, especially to her mother in law. If she failed to bear a son, one or more concubines would be brought in. Most men of means routinely visited brothels but a woman who was unfaithful to her husband could be punished by death” (Pg. 8). This example portrays the dominance of men in everyday household decisions and their ownership of their wives. One very shocking example was Yen Mah’s grandmother’s father told her on her wedding day that he would be most proud of her if she subversed herself to the Yen family, bore her husband many sons, catered to all of her husband’s needs and desires, and renounced her own desires for her family’s welfare. The idea of a father saying to a daughter to not be happy for the rest of her life, reveals the objectifying of women in early 1900’s China. Moreover, even extraordinary successful women in this time period, such as Yen Mah’s Grand Aunt, who single-handedly established one of the most thriving banks in the history of China, in a time when women weren’t allowed to make everyday decisions, was called by her grandchildren “Grand Uncle”, a male title. Despite her remarkable achievements, she was inevitable under the shadow of a man. Yen Mah’s portrays herself as a child, who heard these stories, and still hoped to become successful. She gets this inspiration from her Grand Aunt, indicated by describing her as, “I remember Grand Aunt as a tall, imposing figure, treated with great esteem by every member of our family. Even Ye Ye and Father deferred to her every wish, which was remarkable in a society where women were disdained.” (Pg. 8). Her Grand Aunt represents a symbol of hope and success for young Yen Mah, an idol to be worshipped. She also looked up to her grandfather whom she called Ye Ye. To Yen Mah, Ye Ye was a remarkable businessman and a great person. While most men in China went to brothels, Ye Ye was so faithful to his wife, that when his boss offered him a concubine after a huge business profit, he refused, claiming to be a one-woman man, and reported all of this to his wife in writing. Yen Mah also describes Ye Ye as responsible and serious when saying, “Ye ye had a secret. He was prone to seasickness and hated to set foot on board one of his own sampans. So, though his business was profitable, he decided to sell and move up north, leaving his family behind as Aunt Baba and Father both attended local catholic missionary schools which were considered the best in China and he did not wish to disrupt their education”. This shows Yen Mah’s fondness of her grandfather by portraying him as wise and brave to leave family behind for the sake of his children’s education. The author shows herself to be defined by others around her, especially her family. She learns and grows with their wisdom and love. Although great challenges lie ahead of her in her childhood life, she draws the strength she needs from Aunt Baba, Ye Ye, and her grandmother. However, sometimes, the author leaves out emotions from some of her stories. For example, when she first discusses about her mother’s death, instead of letting her audience know the detrimental effect of that event on her childhood, she end the chapter with the following quote, “My mother died two weeks after my birth, with five doctors at her bedside, she was only thirty years old and I have no idea what she looked like. I have never even seen her photograph” (Pg. 24). This quote presents a sheer emotionless report of her mother’s death, which brings up the question of whether she misses her mother too much, or is confused of her feelings. Regardless, this informs the audience of the sensitive topic of the death of the author’s mother. In the first few chapters, Yen Mah portrays herself as a young, unwanted child in her family, who always is the odd one out. Her eldest sister has the trust and favor of her stepmother, her older brothers have each other, her father has her stepmother, and Aunt Baba is busy most of the time with her work. This leaves her with a horrifying childhood to endure especially since her stepmother has a strong distaste for her. Nonetheless, Yen Mah does endure this childhood and goes on to become successful in her life. It would not be wrong to credit a part of that success to the inspirations Yen Mah drew from her Grand Aunt, the tradition defying businesswoman of China, Aunt Baba, who cared for her in her childhood when no one would, and Ye Ye, who taught her to cherish her culture and her core values. So while her family members do accuse her for her mother’s death, she always stands up to them to say no. It would not be wrong to say that she inherited some of her Grand Aunt’s defying characteristics.
