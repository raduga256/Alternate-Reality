        The period of American Revolution from 1775-1800 was a result of the British oppression upon American colonists that started after the French and Indian War. The British imposed heavy direct and indirect taxes, issued acts like the Stamp Act and the Coercive (Intolerable to the colonists) Acts. The British were challenging the fundamentals Enlightenment ideas that the colonists had deep beliefs in. They were abusing the rights of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness of the colonists. The result was that great thinkers in America like Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and George Washington came together and wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776, which gave a public declaration that America is breaking off from all ties with Great Britain. However, this wasn’t the first time a document has discussed fundamental rights of man in history. The Magna Carta (1215), English Bill of Rights (1689), and the American Bill of Rights (1789) were all written because of oppression from a king or ruler. The American Revolution was of great significance for other revolutions around the world. It influenced the French Revolution (1789) where the oppressive government was overthrown and Napoleon took over, and the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) where slaves rose for their fundamental rights. The American Revolution itself was a combination of changes and continuities. The American Revolution brought about change by organizing social (violent and nonviolent) rebellions against unjust British laws such as the Proclamation Line of 1763, the Stamp Act and the Intolerable Acts, by politically breaking off from the British empire and creating its own national government (Articles of Confederation) with new industrial economic goals, and respecting the social fundamental rights of every man regardless of his social class or economic status. At the same time, the revolution maintained continuities such as wealth gap between people, continued slavery,  a strong sense of enmity with the Indians, and limited rights for women.
        One of the biggest change brought by the American Revolution was the general grudge against the British empire inside of the colonists. It started with the Proclamation Line of 1763 which turned the Ohio River valley into Royal Indian Reserve and forbade colonists from settling west of the Appalachian mountains. The Ohio River valley was the place that the colonists fought the French and Indian war for in the first place. And now, Britain forbids them to live there. This made colonists resent the British empire. When the colonists still settled in the river valley (it was nearly impossible to strictly enforce the proclamation), Ottawa chief Pontiac led a rebellion in western Pennsylvania in May 1763 due to conflicts between colonists and indians in the river valley. Disgusted with Pontiac’s rebellion and the failure of colonial government to keep the people’s interest secured, Paxton Boys of Lancaster killed 6 Indian men, women, and children. The British promised to enforce their agreement with the Indians. After this, Britain passed the Stamp Act in 1765 which imposed a tax on commonly used items like cards, dice, legal documents, newspapers, pamphlets, and advertisements to pay for the debt incurred by Britain during the French and Indian War. Anger and discontent led the colonists to hold the Stamp Act Congress, the Virginia Resolves, boycott British textiles, and violent protests by the Sons of Liberty. The first three were nonviolent protests in hope that the British government would understand their problems because of the Stamp Act. The Stamp Act Congress (first continental congress) even sent a petition for this to Britain. But the Sons of Liberty had different ideas. They tarred and feathered the British officials who tried to enforce the unfair taxes and planted liberty poles in celebration of colonial self government. However, regardless of the way of protest, all colonists strongly resented the colonial government for this direct taxation. However, colonists did not want or were prepared to separate from the British empire yet. But then people read and observed in the 1700s that the British government was not virtuous at all and violated all enlightenment ideas. It didn’t put the public welfare in front of the king’s selfishness, or limited its own power. This was essentially the critical point where the colonists could have been stopped. However, the Boston Massacre of 1770 (British soldiers attacked colonists and killed 5 colonists) and the Boston Tea Party of 1773 (colonists threw tea offboard a ship in protest to tax on it), made the unsure colonists chose their sides. Enraged by such actions, Britain passed the Coercive Acts (Intolerable Acts for the colonists). The Acts shut down all trade ports in Boston which affected trade and commerce in all the colonies, all elected positions such as local judges in Massachusetts were to be appointed by British king, all royal officials received trials in different colony or even in Britain, and increased powers were given to French speaking Catholics in Canadian province of Quebec. As if that was not enough, Britain passed the Quartering Act of 1765, that allowed military commanders to live in houses among the colonists. The colonists also had to pay the rent and give food to the military. These laws were literally openly challenging the colonists to protest and gave a clear message that the British government was not virtuous. In 1774-1775, colonists start talking about breaking apart from the British empire. In 1776, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence which was the definite decision of all the colonies. People could no longer take the oppression of Britain over them. They wanted to drive away from them every British who wanted to see them in “chains of tyranny” to their island of Britain where they would enjoy their slavery and to never let them return to the happy and free land of America (Document A). The colonists have come as far from quietly bearing heavy taxes from Britain to declaring their independence from the British empire. It was without any doubt, a major change brought by the American Revolution.
        Other major changes brought by the revolution were American politically breaking off from the British empire, creating its own national government, and respecting the fundamental rights of every man. After George Washington, the commander of the American army at that time, fought victorious battles against the British army, American army finally drove them out of America. Since the new country needed a new constitution, the Articles of Confederation were written in 1777, and ratified by all 13 states in 1781. This new government was purposely made weak so that America doesn’t look like absolutist European countries. However, this plan backfired as the government became too weak. It didn’t have the power to tax people which was its prime reason of failure. Moreover, the Articles had little power to maintain military forces or suppress rebellions. One such example is the Shays’s rebellion. When Massachusetts government aggressively taxed people, depressed economy along with taxes made earning a living extremely hard for farmers like Daniel Shays. The rebellion led by Shays disrupted government operations. The national government was not able to suppress the rebellion because of weak army. Eventually the rebellion fades away but the Articles still remained weak. To fix this, all the states come together in the Constitutional Convention in 1787, threw away the Articles of Confederation, and made a new constitution from scratch. This shows how the people in the newly independent America didn’t tolerate any kind of unfair government taxation at all. Moreover, the government cares for people, as all the states discarded the Articles and replaced it with a better constitution that would give more power to federal government to maintain more order. This is another example of a change in the mindset of people brought by the American Revolution. Since the government of America was based on enlightenment ideals, everyone in the country had basic rights to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. This was major change from the colonial period because, people had minimal rights and  representation under the rule of British government in colonial America. After the revolution, no person was forced to believe in any particular religion, and essentially everyone was free to hold any opinion on religion or practice their own religion (Document C). This was a very radical change, after colonists faced religious discrimination when the Intolerable Acts gave more rights to French Catholics than the colonists. Another major change because of the revolution was the emergence of different ideas for the future of America. On one hand, Alexander Hamilton pictured an industrialized America, and on the other hand, Thomas Jefferson pictured America as a future country of virtuous farmers. Jefferson’s support for this claim was that America should not base itself on European industrialized nations, because Europe was desperate to turn to industrialization because of lack of land, which America has in plenty after independence. Jefferson believes that farmers are the most vigorous, virtuous, and valuable citizens who truly keep the country’s liberty and interests in mind, and therefore they should not be made into sailors or artisans if they can become a farmer (Document B). The purpose of Jefferson to write this is to express the ideas and focusses of the Democrat-Republicans. He didn’t want Hamilton’s industrial ideas to be the future of America. As a result, Jefferson tried to spread his virtuous intentions so that people can see that his ideas are better for American society than Hamilton’s ideas are. These were the major changes that were brought by the American Revolution. These changes were radical in the sense that they were based on enlightenment ideals.
        However, even after the revolution, there were continuities kept in the American society like wealth gap between people, continued slavery,  a strong sense of enmity with the Indians, and limited rights for women. It is often a topic of argument on who really benefitted from the revolution. In broader terms, white men benefitted the most. They still had their land and slaves after the war. The revolution didn’t turn out to be as beneficial for middle and lower class people. Although most of these people gained a lot of respect from contributing in the revolutionary cause, they were still poor. People like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were rich men before and after the war. Therefore, wealth gap among social classes stayed the same throughout and after the revolution. Slavery was still legal and practiced in independent America. Someone couldn’t force a person to be a slave, but still lawfully own slaves previously owned. Therefore, if someone’s slave runs away, the owner has complete legal right, to reclaim the slave  and claim his or her service (Document E). Indians were in an even worse condition than the slaves. The Americans refused to sign any kind of peace treaty with the Indians. The Indians were disappointed to find that the Americans didn’t include the Indians while negotiating peace with Britain (Document D). The purpose of the United Indian Nations to say this was to hope that the Americans might forgive them for siding with Britain in the war and negotiate some peace with them too. The Americans felt betrayed by the indians after most of them sided with Britain during the revolution. After their victory, the colonists sought revenge from them. The colonists felt justified in taking Indian lands for themselves. The colonists and Indians fought for the fertile northwestern region of Ohio river valley. Once, even the Indian army defeated the American army. Then, Washington formed the Legion of the United States which was a much more trained army than Sinclair’s army that lost to the Miami Confederacy. In the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, General Wayne led the legion and slaughtered the Indian army. The indians were devastated to see the British refuse for help which they promised. The result was Treaty of Greenville in 1795 which gave up the Ohio River valley to the Americans. Another continuity after the revolution was the limited rights for women. Even though women contributed by teaching good values to children in the revolution, they felt that they should still get more rights. They reasoned that their gender should not be perceived as weak or timid, and that if women are allowed to read, why not serve in public offices or take part in public matters (Document G). Molly Wallace’s intended audience for this claim are other women and all men that think that women are incapable. She is effectively trying to change public opinion on women though this. These are the continuities that remained even after the revolution.
        In conclusion the changes brought by the revolution were, a revolutionary mindset that protested against unjust British laws, politically breaking off from Britain and creating a new federal government, and respecting the general fundamental rights of every man. The continuities were wealth gap, slavery, enmity with Indians, and limited women rights. However, in my opinion, the radical changes far outweigh the continuities. This is because, those changes were the reason that America was able to become independent. Sooner or later, women would gain more rights and slavery would be abolished but this couldn’t have happened without America being an independent nation. Therefore, the American Revolution brought far more radical changes than it kept continuities in the American society.EXPLORING ANTEBELLUM AMERICA 1820-1860 -:

Ramansh Sharma, Period 3, Term Research Paper


                                         December 18, 1835
It has been twelve days since my mother has passed away. Both my parents dead, and my cotton farm does not bear any good amount of harvest. Last night, my wife, being extremely religious and deeply influenced by the second Great Awakening like me, advised me to explore the country outside of our hometown Carlton, Georgia, so that I can experience what is to be an American and possibly find a new mode of living for my family. She says that the trip will help me cut down on my arrogance that I have. I would have argued against this suggestion, but she said that God himself had commanded her in her dream last night to tell me this, so I knew I had to do it. I did not want to leave my wife alone with the our male slave we had at home. But I was convinced when Sally insisted that she will be safe. I packed my bag with some food Sally packed for me, money, and few shirts and pants, and dressed myself with a white linen shirt, black pants and shoes, and my overcoat. I fetched my hat, kissed Sally goodbye,  and left the house to explore America. I am also keeping this diary so as to record my periodic interactions and reflecting on them.
I first decided to travel to Miami, Florida to learn more about how to tame slaves since mine has been giving me some trouble lately, so I bought a railroad ticket for that. The railroad system  in the South at this time was undercapitalized. The South invested about $6,000 less per mile in railroad development than the rest of the nation [1]. Still, it was shameful that the price of the ticket was so high. Not having the money to buy the expensive ticket, whose price I prefer not to mention, I pleaded an army officer standing nearby on the station to kindly allow me to travel on the army baggage train about to leave. I asked him so, “Please Sir, I beg you to let me travel with you on this train. I don’t have a lot of money, and I must get to Florida. All I have to offer you is this meatloaf my wife packed for me for my journey”. The officer must have been in good mood for he let me on without taking any of my food or money. I boarded one of the center cars of the train, and found the different cabins filled with sacks of cotton all around me. I threw my bag on the floor, settled on a pile of cotton sacks in one of the corners in the cabin and slept away as the sun went down.
                          February 26, 1836
A lot has happened since I last wrote in this diary. After I boarded the train to Florida from Georgia, the same night, a group of Seminole Indian tribe led by their leader Osceola ambushed our army baggage train for food and ammunitions [2]. By daybreak, they had tied our hands to our back and gagged our mouths. We had no choice but to follow these horrendous savages. While they were directing us into the woods, I noticed that all of these tribesmen were carrying guns and primitive spears. I would have asked them some questions on my mind like why are they doing this or where are they taking us, but alas! these animals could not speak english. Suddenly I was taken aback as one of the military officers, the very one that let me on the train, tried to escape. He unfortunately only ran about twenty feet before being impaled on the back of his neck by one Indian. They threw his body away like garbage and moved on. This event changed my perspective on Indians completely. I thought they were like apes and monkeys who had no sense of violence, let alone killing people with such harsh ways. Now I see their true colors. All I could do was keep my voice down so as to not being attention to me. It was now that I regret not embracing my wife enough when I left. I now see that my life, a thin thread joining my consciousness and the mortal world, could be severed with such ease by these barbarous Indians. When we reached their hideout, I saw a young, energetic, man who was wrestling [3] with other Indians around him in an arena. As he was exiting the arena wearing a hunting shirt with long sleeves that came down to his knees [4], we were brought near him and made to get on our knees. The Indians who captured us bowed in respect to him and left us there. He watched us for a few minutes and left too. Later on that night, our hands were untied and we were given food and water. I ate the meat quickly and drank some water, and washed my hands and face with the rest. I saw the leader nearby and approached him. He was my only chance of escaping this hell. As I came forward, he turned towards me, put his hand on his chest, and said one word, “Osceola”. I bowed in respect and introduced myself. To my surprise, he understood everything. I knew I had to be calm and not let my anger on these people get me slaughtered, so I asked Osceola with my best tone why he was doing all this to us. He replied in an exasperated tone, “Dear friend, this is a message for your government who wants us to migrate west, but we don’t want to” he replied 
“The white man says I shall go, and he will send people to make me go; but I have a rifle, and I have some powder and some lead. I say, we must not leave our homes and lands. If any of our people want to go west we won’t let them; and I tell them they are our enemies, and we will treat them so, for the Great Spirit will protect us [5] ”. 
After this conversation, we were told to sleep in some beds made from animal hides and skins. They also gave me back my diary for which I thanked them. After a few days of rest, I accounted my whole experience with the Indians in here. They have told me that they will let me go with respect and all my belongings very soon as I am not affiliated with the army they caught me with. Apart from their brutal savagery and wilderness, the Seminoles are also friendly to their loved ones. They sing in groups, dance around bonfires at nights, drink from the same cups, and fight beside each other.
                                                                                                  May 4, 1838
        After spending a few more months with the Seminoles, Osceola decided it was time for me to leave. His men were kind enough to escort me to the nearby train station. There, I bought a pack of tickets that would allow me to take several trains to reach North Carolina, far away from Indian tribes. I boarded an afternoon train from Georgia and started my journey. As the train made stops along the way, I used to stop at different places along and stay in guest houses to learn more about the Southern way of living. With the war looming over our heads, I thought it might be a good idea to know about the reasons of it. What I could say now after talking to different people is that the prime reason of the war is that the Northern states want to contain the spread of slavery whereas the Southern states want to continue spreading slavery into newly acquired territories by the country. I, as a slave owner myself, can say that people who have slaves should be allowed to retain them as they own them as legal properties. However, I currently don’t have an opinion on the expansion of slavery. Anyway, I have been lately residing in Raleigh, North Carolina for the past year and a half, and I have been meeting some famous people lately. Yesterday morning, I visited the market to buy fruits and vegetables for the week. I was just leaving a shop when a nicely decorated and lavish wagon passed by me. It was a sight of pure beauty. The horse was as white as milk, with purple drapes over and the wagon was covered in bright red fabric. I caught a glimpse of the man inside but I could not recognize him. My curiosity led me to follow the wagon and luckily it was not going to fast. As it made a stop in front of a building that looked like a town hall, the man sitting inside slowly came out. I immediately went to him and introduced myself and I came to know that he was Noah Webster. I happen to know about some of his achievements such as his famous American dictionary, and his works on etymology. Although, I have heard rumors that Webster’s ten year work on tracing the history of english words was misguided because Webster was turned religiously blind after reading the Bible too literally [6]. His dismissive attitude towards German philologists seem to be responsible for his failure as an etymologist [7]. As I was trying to start a conversation with him, I happen to have an idea to start a local magazine after I was done with this trip. It would definitely help me raise some money for my family back at home. Anyway, for that idea I need to have an interview with Webster. Luckily I took out the small notebook and pen I was carrying, and without any delay, I politely asked him, “Sir, would you be so kind to give this poor man a small piece of your wisdom? Not too long. I just have a few questions”. Surprisingly, he invited me in the building. We headed towards a glass table with polished wooden chairs. As we settled down, I started by asking, “Mr. Webster, I have lately heard that your deep religiosity is a result of you being deeply affected by the second Great Awakening and that you believe that Adam and Eve were endowed with the faculty of language by God and that from that language has descended every single human language that has come into existence [8] ”. To this, he cleverly replied, “Where’s the question in that”. After that the extremely curious audience around us broke into a laugh which was stopped by Webster raising his hand. I realized I should be more careful with this man so I rephrased by question, “Sorry sir, I meant to ask is all that true about you and if so why do you think so? ”. This time he replied with the answer, “The strong affinity of the languages of Asia and Europe, furnished a strong argument in favor of the scriptural doctrine, that all nations have descended from a single pair, Adam and Eve. [9] ”. I was so amazed by this thoughtful response that I just let my emotions speak for me, “Sir, I am honestly deeply influenced by your opinion. I am speechless to your explanation. Thank you very much, I hope you have a wonderful day ahead”. Now I see how deeply one can be affected from spiritual attachment to God. What I heard from Webster shows that all languages have risen from the same ancestor. Might this also mean that all races have risen from the same ancestor too? I might have asked his opinion on it but the man was in a hurry and had to leave. If only I could be one of those lucky souls to unite with the Almighty, I might get enlightened too. With this I returned to my place and wondered which other famous people could I meet on this trip.
                                                                                        March 16, 1844
        After staying for about six years in North Carolina, I wanted to move more into the North and see how people are different over there. I decided this morning to move to Trenton, New Jersey. As I prepared to venture into the foreign lands, I went over my belongings: a few shirts, four pants, two black coats, a hat, some small utensils, a watch, and some bread. I was pretty impressed with my new haircut I got this morning. I had a small fight with the wagon owner that took me to the train station because he was charging me more than usual, probably because of the extra weight I was carrying. I bought a ticket for the first class cars in my train. I wonder how excited Sally would have looked knowing her husband has made enough money to afford a first class ticket. I personally chose it because the first class cabins have larger windows, which I like seeing through. Sitting on my leather seat, I saw this man sitting in front of me holding a paper in one hand, a pen in the other, with his head so leaned on the window that it was hard to see his full face. I cleared my throat to get his attention. No response. I cleared it louder this time and some other passengers turned their eyes toward me including the man in front of me. He turned around and I got to see his face. This person would stand about five feet, seven inches, had an attractive open face with a broad forehead, a strong Roman nose, and a slightly receding chin covered with a beard [10]. He had a full head of fine light brown hair and deep piercing blue-gray eyes [11]. He strided with an unusual energy [12]. He opened his mouth and said, “Greetings there fellow passenger. Do you want to ask or tell me something ?”. He seemed like a nice gentleman so I introduced myself to him. As he introduced himself to me, I came to know he was Henry David Thoreau, the famous poet who writes about nature. I wondered though, how could one stare outside a train while sitting in the lavish and exotic first class cabins. I asked Thoreau, “Sir, I could not help but notice that you were so occupied with staring outside the train window while sitting in a first class cabin. How could one stare at the wilderness of the outside world while sitting right in man made heaven?”. To this, the philosopher replied, “Dear friend, you are clearly misguided in your thoughts. This metal automaton which you call heaven from inside is a mere nuisance to the people outside.”, he sighed and continued in the most angry tone, 
“What an infinite bustle! I am awakened almost every night by the panting of the locomotive. It interrupts my dreams. There is no sabbath. It would be glorious to see mankind at leisure for once. It is nothing but work, work, work. I cannot easily buy a blank book to write thoughts in; they are commonly ruled for dollars and cents….If a man is tossed out a window when an infant, or scared out of his wits by the Indians, it is regretted chiefly because he was thus incapacitated for business! I think there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay to life itself, than this incessant business [13].”
I sworn to control my anger on this trip but this gentleman just went above the line. I replied in an equally angry tone, “Well, sorry to say that you do not like the advancements that humanity is making, but then why are you even travelling in a train ?”. The old man took a deep breath and calmly answered that he is deeply disturbed by the railroad and how it is affecting the whole Nation [14]. He also added, “Wages is a cunning device of the devil for the benefit of tender consciences who would retain all the advantages of the slave system without the expense, trouble, and odium of being slaveholders. [15]”. I immediately realized he was attacking the factory owners in the north. I have heard that factory owners in north are so brutal to their workers that they are paid very less, for long working hours, and are often abused. I see now from Thoreau’s answer that these rumors are true. Maybe he is right in saying that slavery is a lot like this factory hell. Christ! May not I get cursed to work in one of those factories! After I arrived in Trenton, I thanked Thoreau for his conversation with me and he thanked in return. After thinking for some while, I had some thoughts that might be considered crazy and moronic. Maybe, slavery is after all bad. Maybe, blacks are human beings with feelings. If they are in reality human beings, it’s a shame to the white race for carrying out such acts of brutality towards them. Maybe, this nation needs to change. If only everyone would listen to Thoreau for once, they would see, that slavery is like factory work, unethical.
                                                                                              June 28, 1846
        I have been growing my beard lately and observed that it is turning all white. This means that I am becoming the victim of the inevitability of age and that I am gathering more and more wisdom. This afternoon, as I was roaming the streets of Trenton, I decided to treat myself to a cup of coffee. I stopped by a café and ordered a coffee. As I waited for my drink, I saw this man sitting on the table to my left, with his hands in his hair, trying to write something down. He seemed as if he had been trying for hours, but could not decide if his work was good. I felt pity seeing a man like this. I went up to his table took off my hat and asked if I could sit in the seat in front of him. As he nodded yes and curiously studied my face, I kindly asked him, “Sir I could not help but notice that you seem quite stressed with what you are trying to write. May I help you in any way”. The man replied with a smile, “My name is John L’ O’Sullivan. I the chief writer and editor of the Democratic Review magazine. Lately, as you might have heard that Congress has given the federal order to annex the territory of Texas and are currently arguing about President Polk’s request to authority to give formal notice to Great Britain of the termination of the agreement under which the two nations had jointly occupied the Oregon country since 1818 [16]. Well, I support the annexation of these territories by our country, and by our superior race. I have written something here that I am not sure is appealing. Would you be so kind to listen me read it to you?”. I immediately realized he was the next famous person for my future magazine and I agreed to hear him out. O’Sullivan started reading his work,
“The great future of the modern world is the growth and power of the The Anglo-Saxon race. The race is not divided into nearly powerful parts, one of  which, in the position of great political power, occupies the British islands, and from there sways the commercial world. The other inhabits the continent of North America, and will soon absorb the whole one vast union, from whose bosom, the British islands must thereafter draw their supplies of food, and become measurably dependent for the elements of their power….The practical annexation of the manufacturing interests of England to the agricultural interests of the United States through free trade, again unites the Anglo-Saxon race in an indissoluble bond, and gives a new impulse to the prosperity of this glorious union. [17]”
I was amazed by this piece of pure wisdom. I must have been staring blankly at his face because O’Sullivan had to say my name twice to shake me out of my wonder. I now see that I am not the only one to think that the white race is superior to other races. But I also see that O’Sullivan’s ideas are in direct conflict with the ideas I inferred from Webster’s claim of all languages rising form the same ancestor and Thoreau’s comparison of slavery and factory work. I had so much on my mind that I thanked O’Sullivan and returned home. I probably should have asked him how to start my own magazine. So not thoughtful of me! I wish I meet more people on this trip who can give me more insights on this topic of racial comparison.
                                                                                                      October 12, 1848
        A few months ago, as I was spending my time in Trenton, I figured it had been too long since I have met another person for interviewing for my magazine. So I started researching and asking people who would be some good people for me to interview to get to know northern viewpoints in more depth. All inquiries ended up in two names: Lydia Maria Child who is an abolitionist and women's rights activist, and Frederick Douglass who is a freedman and also an abolitionist. I heard that Child was in Boston, Massachusetts right now, so I quickly packed a bag with a few clothes, my diary, my another diary for interviewing, and my collection of pens. I took the morning train to Boston and reached the city at about noon. I took a wagon and headed to the building she was residing in. While travelling to her place, I faintly recalled that Mrs. Child has written a book about history of slavery, laws about slaves and free blacks, she gives an argument against racism and slavery as well [18]. Moreover, she even accounts for blacks noted for achievements such as doctors, or lawyers, or military men [19] which is quite surprising. As I was trying to tell the security guard at the front to let me in as it was crucially important for me to talk to Mrs. Child, he was “bound by his orders”. Luckily, Mrs. Child saw me and told that guard to let me in. I introduced myself to her and she was, surprisingly, interested in giving me an interview and answer my questions. I immediately sat down with her on a table and asked her, “Mrs. Child, I have heard that you are a women’s rights activist but you also support abolition. I do not see why you would support abolition when you have an equally hard goal to achieve more important to you?”. To this, Mrs. Child replied, “Mr. Goldsmith. May I ask you if you are a slave owner?”. I looked down and nodded. “Then may I also ask you why are you against emancipation of slaves?”. I answered in an angry tone, “I fear their equality to us. How can those slaves, who are meant to serve us for eternity walk amongst us like regular citizens with rights ?”. Mrs. Child now gave me a logical answer, “First, allow me to tell you that I work equally hard for women’s rights as I do for emancipation because both are the right things to do. But coming back to topic of emancipation”, then with a sigh she added, 
“I am aware that this desirable change must be attended with much more difficulty in the Southern States, simply because the evil has been suffered until it is fearfully overgrown; but it must not be forgotten that while they are using their ingenuity and strength to sustain it for the present, the mischief is increasing more and more rapidly. If this be not a good time to apply a remedy, when will be a better? They must annihilate slavery, or slavery will annihilate them [20].”
I understood that she saw enslaving someone as a moral issue that would lead to the disaster of our society, but why did she not consider that if slaves are set free they will bring chaos because of their barbaric and ignorant nature? When I asked her this question, Mrs. Child replied, 
“It seems to be forgotten that emancipation from tyranny is not an emancipation from law; the negro, after he is made free, is restrained from the commission of crimes by the same laws which restrain other citizens: if he steals, he will be imprisoned: if he commits murder, he will be hung. It will, perhaps, be said that the free people of color in the slave portions of this country are peculiarly ignorant, idle, and vicious? It may be so: for our laws and our influence are peculiarly calculated to make them bad members of society [21]. Think about that Mr. Goldsmith. Goodbye!”
This response changed my life. It gave me a completely different opinion on slavery. I do not know if I will be able to keep my slave anymore. First thing after leaving this building is to buy Mrs. Child’s book on slavery. I now have a pretty good understanding on what northerners think of slavery as. And maybe, they are right. Even if blacks are freed, so what, they will be like regular citizens. They won’t be taking over us. If they attack me, they will be jailed. And this nation would only prosper with the added intelligence of the blacks.  
                                                                                                    July 4, 1852
        After my meeting with Mrs. Child, I decided to make my way to Frederick Douglass, the former slave and present abolitionist. I went to the harbor in Boston and found the fastest steam ship there. Luckily the captain allowed me to board after I agreed to pay extra fifty dollars. I did get a little seasick on the way but I needed to get to Rochester, New York, to hear Douglass give a speech on independence day. When I reached New York, I got on a train and arrived at Rochester about twenty minutes after Douglass’s speech had already started. I hurriedly walked to  the majestic Corinthian Hall in downtown Rochester near the Genesee River [22], and the hall, unsurprisingly, was filled with about five to six hundred people [23]. As I made my way across the crowd to reach one of the VIP seats I had booked, I started to hear words from Douglass that really caught my attention as I sat down - “I am bound to speak, and whenever there is an opportunity to do so, I will speak against slavery. This, for the purpose of the celebration, is the Fourth of July. It is the birthday of your National Independence, and of your political freedom [24]”. This part brought tears in my eyes. Douglass’s voice today, was the voice of all slaves, in North and South, as one divine force speaking of it’s suffering. The idea that someone living in America is not allowed to celebrate July 4th as an occasion of independence is terrible. But that is the ugly truth for slaves. Douglas, on the other hand gave hope through his speech. Hope for setting things right - 
“...your nation is so young….You are, even now, only in the beginning of your national career, still lingering in the period of childhood. There is hope in the thought, and hope is much needed, under the dark clouds which lower above the horizon….Were the nation older, the patriot’s heart might be sadder, and the reformer’s brow heavier. Its future might be shrouded in gloom, and the hope of its prophets go out in sorrow. [25] ” 
Frederick Douglass has really touched my heart. One can only imagine how much pain a former slave would have to bear talking about abolition in front of a white crowd on a day that marks independence. But he spoke stronger that anyone I have ever seen. His optimism is truly inspiring. I have hereby gone through an experience comparable to the great awakening. Slavery is immoral, unethical, and brutal to me. Moreover, it is illogical for a human being to enslave one another. I, William Andrew Goldsmith, swear to God that I will be emancipating my slave as soon as I reach my hometown.                        
                April 1, 1855
        After my meeting with Frederick Douglass I heard from one of my café friends in New York that Commodore Matthew C. Perry has returned from his voyage from Japan. He had successfully opened up Japan for trade with United States. This news did not excite me too much except that I found another person to interview for my magazine. I inquired and found that Perry would be staying in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for some time. Without wasting time, I picked up my bag and headed for the train station. I reached Pittsburgh in about two days and hired a wagon to take me to the public hall where Perry was staying in. As I paid and got off the wagon, I saw there was a long line to a stage. I asked around and heard that these all were journalists for newspapers and want to gather information from Perry. I joined the line. I happen to remember how Perry got sent to Japan. The developing trade with China, growth of U.S. whaling industry, the opening up of California, progress of steam navigation, good treatment of shipwrecked sailors, and competition with Britain for far east trade, all stimulated the interest in Japan, and for this mission, Matthew Perry was chosen [26]. While waiting, I recall that Perry had mixed feelings about the Japanese [27]. He hated Japanese deceits and chicanery, yet was fond of his Japanese counterparts [28]. At about five in the afternoon, my turn came and I went up to the stage. Perry was an old man. His hair had thinned and his face completely wrinkled. He reflected my father’s portrait weeks before he died. As I approached the chair in front of him, he yelled out to the rest of the line behind me, “That’s it! Last interview! I need to rest before returning to New York!”. Well, fortunate I was! I sat down, introduced myself, and asked my question, “Sir, what do you think of Japanese intellect and behaviour towards us Americans?”. To this, the Commodore answered, 
“No person in the world exceeded the Japanese in politeness and courtesy as well as to strangers as to each other, and they are systematic in that as in all other matters, suiting the forms of their salutations to the rank and position of the person saluted. Where I have never seen a city or town exhibiting a greater degree of cleanliness….from the filthiness of all Chinese cities….Although, I have never seen such an amount of apparent wretchedness as these squalid slaves would seem to suffer. [29]”
Holy Jesus! Perry actually has mixed feelings for the Japanese. I learned from him that Chinese cities are extremely dirty, and that Japanese cities are not. But more importantly, I learnt from Perry the same lesson I learnt from Douglass, Mrs. Child, Webster, and Thoreau. Slavery is a wretched disease of society. It is to be immediately removed for it is purely evil and unethical. After asking him that, I took his leave and went to a nearby hotel to stay for the night. I can’t wait to get back home and start my magazine. I am not going to stop. I will keep meeting famous people in this country. And all this credit goes to my dear wife, Sally, who encouraged me to go on this trip to rediscover who I am and what it is to be an American.

I was baffled when I saw my new classmate answer the teacher while slacking in their desks. I never really fit in. Whether it be eighth grade or high school, I never really found myself completely alike my friends. Some topic would always emerge in our conversations, that would put me out of the discussion group. Whether it be knowledge about politics, or sharing funny anecdotes, I would be out of the circle. It was partly because when I came to the U.S. in 2014, I did not know the teen culture of America. It would take me several days in middle school to learn that I did not have to get up from my seat to answer the teacher. Weeks to learn the cafeteria routine, sitting at respective tables with your homeroom class, getting in lines for food, chocolate milk cartons, and mozzarella cheese sticks. It was so much different from India where we were just let loose in the lunch break to roam around the building, be wherever we wanted. It was both restrictive and freeing at the same time. 
My father got a transfer here from his company, for about three to four years. As a result, I came to U.S. on a visa. My middle school friends would bombard me with questions about my home country, the language I spoke, and why I was speaking in an Indian accent. It took me months to change to an American accent, during which I would be ridiculed daily in some light manner or other, with mimicry or explicit indication, for my Indian accent. They would often confuse my religion ‘Hindu’, and my native language ‘Hindi’ for one another. It all changed when I came to Bronx Science.
In high school, my ease for math and science was not taken to be weird. My teachers were proud of me, my parents even more. Bronx Science gave me what I really needed, a home. It was a haven for learning, nourishing young curious minds to bloom. The more I delved into my science classes, the more I wanted to learn, the more knowledge I wanted. I remember in sophomore year, AP Chemistry, I was really intrigued by the molecular bonding of carbon atoms to form molecules of diamond. I raised a question regarding the structural stability of the carbon atoms to bond in this way, to which my teacher responded, “Find the answer for extra credit”. To this, the whole class turned towards me and asked to repeat my questions for they wanted to do the extra credit too. I did the research too, but I did not submit it for extra credit. I do not want my curiosity to have a price on my transcript. It was moments like these that defined me as the person I am today. It was all going well. I mixed with my friends, who shared similar passions with me. I was almost indistinguishable from my friends except that I was from India, not a citizen. This small detail grew to be defining in my senior year.
When looking for colleges, all of my friends did not have to worry about the money in it. They were going to get financial aid. Whereas I had to look for multiple other parameters- which college was I interested in, which one was affordable, which one is affordable for an international student. My father told me that if the fee would be too high, I would have to resort to going back to India for college with my family. If I was lucky enough, I would get to stay here for college. So when applying to colleges, I have to explain my very unusual circumstance to them-: I am originally from India. I am here in U.S. on visa and considered an international student but I have attended all four years of a public high school in New York City. Meanwhile I was helping my father deal with the stress of me being able to attend college her, and consoling my friends at high school dealing with stress over college. No one asked me if I was going under any stress. And I did not complain. I played the wise one and absorbed all my stress. I released it in badminton team, or in a physics test, some miraculous and helpful ways  I deal with stress. 
I am from a middle class family. If I can attend college with the my father’s income going towards the college fee, and my brother’s private high school tuition fee next year when they return to India, it will truly be a dream come true. With a college education, I can advance my interests in computer science and physics, and one day hopefully, work at NASA, where I hope to solve the world’s energy problems with advanced space research. Some of my friends say I dream too big to which I reply,  “one can never dream too big”.Ramansh Sharma                        Opinion Editorial                                  Date-3/5/18

It was a regular night doing my homework when the news on New York Times hit me like rock. Nineteen year old Nikolas Cruz, a former student of the Parkland high school, barged in the school building and used a semi automatic AR-15 rifle. Seventeen students died. 
        But there lies beneath a bigger problem. People are growing ignorant of these shootings. For most people, such news is another daily surprise, which after “expressing condolences” through a tweet or two, is forgotten. A New York Times article put it, “Gunfire ringing out in American schools used to be rare, and shocking. Now it seems to happen all the time…..We have absolutely become numb to these kinds of shootings” [1]. Although most people in America claim to be strongly against gun violence, few actually speak out against it. 
        Moreover, another issue is the ease at which a person can legally obtain a firearm in most states. Not only that, a BBC article states, “The right to own guns is regarded by many as enshrined in the Second Amendment to the US Constitution” [2]. In my opinion, it is threatening to the American society. Regular citizens do not need guns for their protection. The only thing regular people might need to carry guns for is to protect themselves against shooters, who in turn again can obtain a gun easily. This could be prevented if the second amendment was not “fiercely defended by groups such as the National Rifle Association” [3]. An organization legally providing guns to people is what gives the shooters motive to wreak havoc. According to the same article, 60% of all American homicides are with guns, which portrays how serious the issue of firearm availability is.
        But there is hope. After the recent Florida high school shooting, numerous adults and children have set out to make a change. According to polls by Huffington Post, 60 percent of Americans currently believe gun violence is a very serious problem facing the country, up from 53 percent last November [4]. In another poll, more than 50 percent of all age groups believe that gun violence can be stopped. The students from the high school even marched up to White House and demanded for stricter gun control laws. These students were the ones to face the tragedy, and realize in truth the depth of this issue. In an interview from CNN of Cameron Kasky, a survivor of the shooting, Kasky said words that truly show what “our generation” wants - We can't ignore the issues of gun control that this tragedy raises. And so, I'm asking--no, demanding--we take action now [5].
        All Americans are part of a shared web, a shared identity. Walt Whitman encapsulated this idea in his Song of Myself when he said, “And what I assume you shall assume. For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you”. Through this he is trying to convey the idea that everyone in a shared community is the same organism. One big body. One big mind. Therefore, everyone needs to take gun violence seriously because this affect them. In the Boston Massacre, the soldiers opened fire into the public. Even though only a few died, the event became immortal and crucially important to history. In our time, even when scores of people die in a shooting, the news is only….news.
There’s no cowardice or shame in speaking out against gun violence. As Bronx Science students, we do not want any tragedy like this upon us. For that, we all need to make effort and support for stricter gun laws because we decide our own future. And to make the change, we have to be the change. Set an example. Be the city upon a hill.

In the autobiography Falling Leaves, the author, Adeline Yen, gives us a deep look into the life of an unwanted daughter who was shunned by her parents and siblings all her life, but with her sheer determination and the love from her aunt, she achieves her dreams and goes on to become a very successful doctor. Throughout the book, Yen discusses her life as a child living under her tyrannical stepmother Niang. Since all her siblings blame her for their mother’s death, she does not have many people to share her feelings with. When she was young, her grandmother passed away too, leaving Niang in charge of the house, with which power she abused and mistreated the five siblings while over pampering her own children. Towards the end of the book, Yen is now a married adult with two children, working as a professional anesthesiologist. After about thirty one years, she was finally starting to get along with Lydia, her oldest sister, by helping her son out with his education in America. However, when her father dies from alzheimer's disease, and all the children come for the reading of the will, they find out that their father died penniless, “when the young solicitor read out the first page of Father’s will and then announced that there was no money in father’s estate, a collective gasp was audible. We sucked in our breath and looked up at Niang. She calmly glared back at us one by one. Her expression was a combination of triumph and disdain...” (Pg. 236). This was because Niang had taken everything that their father had, his money, his gold, and his properties. As if that wasn’t enough, she ended the recently fixed relationship between Yen and Lydia by manipulating Lydia. This shows in essence the hate that Niang possessed towards all her stepchildren. After two years in her father’s death, Niang gets sick and dies too. When her will is read by James, her favorite stepchild, Yen is astonished to hear that everyone got a share of Niang’s estate except her. Even Lydia, disowned by her parents, received ten percent of Niang’s wealth while Yen, who supported Niang in her surgeries, got nothing. Yen says, “I thought upon my miserable childhood and the abuse Niang had dispensed on those around her. I recalled my elation when I finally escaped from her reign of terror and oppression. And yet it continued to matter to me whether or not she loved me” (Pg 253), to show the deep emotional turmoil she goes under thinking the different possibilities in her head from the first point since meeting Niang to her death that whether or not they departed on good terms, whether she loved her or not. This portrays the longingness of love that Yen has, her trying to fill that void desperately by attempting to amend her terms with her siblings and Niang. It is evident throughout the book that in these attempts, Yen sometimes get misguided. For example, as it turns out, the real reason why Niang suddenly insisted to coming to America to get operated for her cancer after denying Yen’s offer for months, was that if and when she dies in America, the US government would have imposed death duties on Yen’s estate. She is heartbroken from this revelation, further adding on to Niang’s evil portrayal as a hateful being capable of showing no sympathy towards her stepchildren. When Yen and her husband Bob tried to find her father’s will in Niang’s apartment, they found another such heartbreaking revelation. Even when Lydia was disowned by father, she kept a secret conversation with Niang going on, writing to her almost everyday, planting poisonous stories about Yen’s betrayal to Niang when she helped her sister Susan and that Yen was trying to take over control from Niang. To see her own blood and flesh turn on her like that, Yen was shocked and taken aback, wondering whether she is the only one capable of love in her family. This crossroad in Yen’s life depicts her as a compassionate person as she did not sue James in the court even though there was a share that she found her father left for her in his will. Yen says “whatever happens, this, my father’s will, is what is important to me. He at least did not exclude me” (Pg 267) which shows her closure with her turmoil with her parents’ love for her. Upon reading her father’s will, she finally got a last glimpse of one of her most cherished things in the world, her father’s love for her, which she had not seen ever since Niang stepped into their house. One important literary device that occurs throughout the book is the repetition of the phrase, “Suan le!” by James. James says this phrase, meaning “Let it be!”, repeatedly to Yen exclusively throughout the book, sometimes to calm her, other times to calm himself. Its earliest appearance happened when Yen’s pet duckling PLT was killed by Jackie the dog. James consoled Yen to possibly prevent her from taking a harsh action by using this phrase. He uses it again towards the end of the book to try to make Yen drop the case of Niang’s will. Evidently, this use of language proves to effective everytime. Even at the end, when the topic of issue is the matter of inherited wealth, James’s “Suan le!” causes Yen to drop this pursuit as she says, “Sang ge! (Third Elder brother)! It was a great misfortune for us to have had Niang for a stepmother. Don’t worry, I won’t contest her will. I will never allow her to triumph over me.” (Pg 270). In the last chapter of the book, Yen visits her aunt Baba, a very influential and important person in her life, especially in her childhood. When Yen offered aunt Baba to come to America for treatment for her colon cancer, she nonchalantly denied saying “I have had a good run of eighty-nine years. It is time to accept the end. Since there is no hope of a cure, why prolong the agony of dying?” (Pg 272). Hearing this, Yen had a feeling of untethered weightlessness. She understood the deeper meaning of aunt Baba’s decision, that there is no point in pondering over past events, over things that an individual cannot do anything about anymore. A person should be able to live free and clear of any tensions. Yen had been living in fear of Niang and longing of acceptance from her all her life. But after remembering the story aunt Baba used to tell her as a child, she finally found peace with her past. The author uses pathos heavily in the text to reach and connect with the audience on the human level. Although her stories are naturally sad and very unfortunate, her use of word choice and juxtaposition of continuous unfortunate events gives her main idea an emotional depth. By employing this technique, Yen is able to give the readers a sense of what things looked like from her perspective in the specific times. I plan to use this technique in my fiction writing later this year as it proves to be very effective to carry the main idea to the reader in the literal as well as the emotional aspect. I personally enjoyed this book very much. Reading and learning about Yen’s life in China and then her dedicated journey to America and to becoming a doctor is very inspiring and relatable. Since I myself have come from India here, I know firsthand the difficulties an immigrant might face socially here. But just like Yen proves through her story, with determination comes success.Ramansh Sharma                        Podcast reflection                                 Date-10/17/18

New York’s Got Talent: Episode 8 - Matthew Silver & Paperboy the Prince
Notes:
Awkward men saying they have pretty eyes, they like gameboys, and they wear khaki pants. They don't like playing gameboy in public cuz its weird and dangerous in public. Gater pants, someone thought it was snake, it's a shout out to amphibians (reptiles). People give them negative look but they are beautiful creatures. A talent show hosted sometime before. The people are street performers. “How would you describe your performance”- the collaboration was good, perform with music, it was nice. Paperboy is a rapper, motivator, basketball player, music creator, nice person. One guy calls himself a fartist. They act like cartoon characters. Fidget spinners. Matrix.


This podcast made by a group of friends who are street artists and performers, was especially interesting to me. Since I had a bad perception of podcasts as a form of literature/art previously, I was trying to pick the best podcast I could listen to. As unimaginable as I thought it would be, I could not pick a podcast. There were just too many options and a large variety. So I took a suggestion from my friend and listened to this podcast from Matthew Silver. This podcast was unlike all the ones I have heard until now. All the podcast I heard until now were about tragic and sad events - parent’s death, car/truck accidents, losing someone close to oneself. As a result, I wanted to shift to science fiction, something I could relate to. But I ended up listening to this podcast, and I enjoyed it to the fullest. Unlike others, one thing I really liked about the speakers in this podcast was that they were not telling one story that was sad and was supposed to have a deep meaningful closing at the end. Rather, these street artists, singers, and dancers, are just talking about old days, sharing small stories from small events. The focused attention on one small moment allowed me to relate to the speakers in the humor side. It was extremely enjoyable, for example, one speaker talks about how he made a small video about playing with a fidget spinner on the street and throw it on the ground, for which he got millions of views. Not only is this story silly and funny, the speaker add a level of casual twist to it by using curse words. Even though it sounds inappropriate and unprofessional sometimes, it does add to the humor, which is a really important component for me to look for in podcasts. Another funny example I remember is when one speaker compliments on the other speaker's khaki pants. The pants had alligators drawn on them. When inquired, the person wearing them explains them to be some kind of reptiles, and how wearing the pants is a shoutout to all the amphibians. Another speaker joins in and says that amphibians and reptiles are misunderstood creatures mostly taken for their jagged scaled and ugly looks, but how they are sincere and nice creatures. This interaction made me laugh. I believe this to be the sign for me that I like the podcast. I am not a natural auditory learner. Podcasts are a new thing to me. As a matter of fact, I am listening to the podcast right now along with writing about it so I do not forget the content later on. Just now, one of the speaker says how not to be discouraged ever in one’s life. Because that is what the machine or the matrix wants you to be like, for you to be soulless. Another speaker just made a joke about how life keeps throwing sh*t at your face and makes it suck for you, but it is just cliché. People sometimes do fake depressing (at Bronx Science also) because they want to relate to people around them. It is also easier to be depressed rather than be inspiring to others. After saying something serious like that, the speakers take the factor down a little and talk about bad singing and demonstrate with weird sounds from their throats. The speakers literally are not trying to convey one story. They are not trying to solve the mysteries of the universe and human behaviour. They are just talking about human beings, being human beings, strengths and weaknesses (kryptonite). I believe that is the greatest strength of this podcast - humor combined with deep messages. If they only talked about their art conventions, or their practices and interactions on the street, I would really bored, really fast. But the jokes and the casual mood kept me hanging in there. I do not like art, but I do like people relating art to daily problems and cliché ideas in America. For example, the speakers talked about how hard it to be a street artist and live in New York, to which then the other artist responded that he should try what he does for some extra money - use an online paypal account from which he gets donations up to $150 for doing small funny video gigs.  Further on, I plan to use the same techniques in my fictional creative writing later on this year. Since it will definitely be related to science and physics, the humor will keep the audience tagged into my stories, while I casually convey my story, in a fun and meaningful way.Ramansh Sharma                              Setting Review                                Date-9/28/18

The author of “Falling Leaves”, Adeline Yen Mah, makes use of sensory details and descriptions of her siblings and family members to show her emotions for them. For example, when Adeline says, “I remember him, full of mischief gazing with rapt fascination… to escape.” (Pg. 35), she uses the one moment in which her eldest brother Gregory, supposedly the most favored one of her parents and grandparents, pulls a trick on their grandfather by pulling his nose hair while he was asleep. This incident portrays her disapproval of Gregory, caused also partly by the fact that he would preclude her when playing with their siblings. She uses juxtaposition to compare Gregory’s elderness to his siblings and being childish and mischievous at the same time. Yet, at the same time, Adeline shows deep appreciation for Gregory. She compliments him by saying, “Good with numbers, he occasionally taught us younger ones neat mathematical tricks, roaring with laughter at his own cleverness” (Pg. 35). This conveys the message to the reader that Adeline does not believe Gregory to be full of himself because of him being elder to others, but rather that the duties of their father were unconditionally passed to a young and happy boy. Adeline also appraises Gregory after her grandmother’s demise when saying, “Every few steps, he would fall on his knees and start bewailing the loss of Grandmother at the top of his voice, banging his head repeatedly on the ground to make obeisance… marvelling at his performance.” (Pg. 40). Here, she ensues physical setting of the monks, incense smell, prayer, to place the gloomy mood in which Gregory bravely takes on his father’s duties to mourn for their grandmother by doing the ritual with utmost emotion. Her grandmother’s death traumatized her so much that she even “half hoped and half feared that her grandmother would come out of her coffin during the night and rejoin them in their life”. She was undoubtedly going through an enormous flux of emotions, which she cleverly never states, but shows through using descriptive physical setting and sensory details of her grandmother’s funeral process and juxtaposition about her perceptions of her brother.
        Adeline also recalls the joys of living under her grandmother’s reign in the house. As the eldest one, she refused to join their father’s offer to live in Shanghai due to security reasons, and continued to live in their Tianjin house because to her, “the essence of life was not which city one lived in, but with whom one lived”. Adeline uses intensive sensory details to describe traditional delectable foods that they would eat everyday and their lavish lifestyles, compared to the plain and unnerving life under Niang’s rule in the house. She describes it as serene while saying, “Aunt Baba ran the household and encouraged us children to invite friends home to play and snack on various dim sims in a way Niang would never have tolerated. Mealtimes were informal and the adults talked and played mah-jong late into the evening. Ye Ye kept a skeleton staff in the office….A chauffeur was hired and on Sundays we were driven to various restaurants to try out different cuisines, including Russian, French, and German. I remember drinking hot  chocolate and eating pastries at the sparkling Kiessling Restaurant while a music trio played Strauss waltzes and Beethoven romances. Sometimes we were even taken to see suitable movies.” (Pg. 38). Adeline describes this period of time as heaven. With being allowed to eat all and any amount of her favorite foods that her stepmother would be furious to see, getting to play with her friends at home, not dealing with formal dinners, going to fancy restaurants in which music played while she ate food, and going for movies, Adeline “shows” the serenity of this time. I really liked how she just didn’t list these luxuries after saying her life was serene. That would have drawn out the emotion and the sensory details out of the story. Rather, she took time and effort to go into brief but intense details of each feature of this golden life, essentially bringing the reader into the story to feel how she felt. Moreover, the fact that these things would make Niang excruciatingly furious, made Adeline feel rebellious and as a winner for once. This technique of “showing” and not just “telling”, I think I can use for my essays too. I can effectively show how my teammates and I were going through increasingly more and more confusion and nervousness, as the time for the hackathon to end came to a close and we still did not have a solution. And then how it just hit me like a spark, I can use similes and metaphors here along with describing the scene with intense details, will definitely catch the emotion in the picture. For my essay about my transformative moment at the top of the Grand Canyon, gazing down four thousand feet through a four inch helicopter window, I could use physical setting to describe how much that one single moment meant to me. For it was extremely horrifying, yet so adventurous that my childhood memories came flushing back to me of how I used to climb up trees and park poles. Just how Adeline uses sensory details to describe her relatives, her grandmother’s funeral, and her golden heavenly times when her father and stepmother went to Shanghai while the rest of the family stayed and enjoyed their lives to the fullest in Tianjin, I can employ the same level of physical setting and sensory details to make my essays better by not only saying certain things, but “showing” them with emotion.﻿With a packet of pretzels in my left hand and my phone in my right hand, I sat hopelessly at a table with four seniors. Five laptops, five brilliant minds, the internet at our fingertips, and we had nothing. It was five in the evening and we were facing a seemingly impossible dilemma.
My hackathon teammates were taking advanced Game Programming while I was just a shy freshmen with minimal knowledge of web design. Our project was truly exceptional: a piano tiles game with integrated hand motions that were detected by a motion sensor armband. The first part came easy, the seniors wrote the code for the basic piano tiles game by noon. But then came the time to implement the hand motions into our game. No one on our team had the slightest idea on how to position them at regular intervals in the game. 
We could hear the joyous laughs and roars of other teams as they triumphantly showed their projects to the supervisors. All this happened while we sat there like statues. With crumbs of pretzels and spills of Gatorade all over us, we waited for a miracle to snap us out of our slumber. The hackathon was nearing its end and without the hand motions, our game would be demoted from something unique and fascinating to a something, well, nothing. My team had little hope left of deciphering this riddle of the Sphinx. However, I was not ready to give up. The hackathon was a haven for me. A place where I was surrounded by people with similar interests, friends who shared my passion and enthusiasm. I cherished this community more than anything. Then, the solution struck me like Zeus’s lightning bolt. 
I did not believe myself at first. There is no way I could have solved something the seniors could not. I explained my solution to Aki, our team leader. When I finished writing the long equation, his eyes lay wide open. Immediately he was thanking me for the solution. He hurried back to the others, dragged them to the whiteboard and let them too, marvel at the solution. The four seniors, in semicircle, turned towards me and congratulated me for the accomplishment. The coders immediately jumped into implementation, with only twenty minutes remaining. I felt content, having contributed meaningfully to the team. 
It took them about ten minutes to write the ten lines of code that made our project enchanted with sweet gaming wizardry. To my surprise, the team quoted me as the key player in the “how did you do it” section of submitting the game. This was the first time I was given the leading credit in a team project. Not only did it make me feel important, but it inspired confidence inside me. 
As the three fates deemed it so, we gave a breathtaking presentation of the game. Aki scored an incredibly high score in the game, bewildering the whole auditorium. The judges and the audience were perplexed by our performance. The presentation ended, and after two seconds of silence, the judges stood up and gave us a standing ovation, followed by the rest of the audience. 
 It is often said in Greek mythology that mortal belief in the gods is what keeps them immortal. On this day, our team’s spirit was immortalized by the belief and praise of the audience. Our team placed first in the hackathon. I learned something about teamwork that day. I learned that I do not always have to be the leader or the best guy in a team to be a contributing teammate. What I needed was fierce curiosity and unmatched perseverance, which this day embedded deep into my lifestyle.Ramansh Sharma                   How to Tell a True War Story                    Date-10/4/18

In “How to Tell a True War Story”, the author Tim O'Brien uses multiple techniques and literary devices to communicate a non-fiction story. However, many parts of his stories are known to be fiction, with vague details and a blurred line between reality and fantasy. When O’Brien says “A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things they have always done….There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil.”, he paints a gloomy picture of the setting in his book, alerting the readers that the dark stories he is about to narrate, are not made up for the purpose of portraying war, but rather to correctly depict it. O’Brien also asserts about the philosophy of a war story when saying, “In many cases a true war story cannot be believed. If you believe it, be skeptical. It’s a question of credibility. Often the crazy stuff is true and the normal stuff isn’t because the normal stuff is necessary to make you believe the truly incredible craziness.” Here, O’Brien is saying that even though the entire story he narrates is true, some more believable untrue parts were added, to make the whole thing seem believable. In this process, he blurs the line between what is fiction and what is not in his book. O’Brien believes war to be one of the few themes which cannot be communicated across normally. One has to manipulate the details, insert emotion and suspense in order to keep the story engaging, otherwise, the story would just be meaningless to tell. O’Brien uses a lot of ambiguity in his book which causes the true parts and the false parts to merge together in a clutter. This ambiguity might come in hand in the personal statement work. I could use it in some sort anecdotes, where if properly used, it will compel the reader to think two or three layers deeper to understand the bigger picture and significance of the story. O’Brien also says, “True war stories do not generalize. They do not indulge in abstraction or analysis” to convey that he is purposely throwing random and miniscule details at the reader to mimic a proper war story. Instead of the author doing all the analysis and reasoning, the readers are expected to put the pieces together in their own way and learn their own moral from the story. Whether the story that O’Brien narrates is true or not, does not matter more than what it teaches. War stories are indeed very difficult to tell. Too much or too little details or events can make the story too vague and meaningless. Therefore, it does not matter if the stories that O’Brien tells are true or not, the lessons are learnt either way.Ramansh Sharma                           The Cathedral                                      Date-12/6/16

In the short story, The Cathedral, the author Raymond Carver, uses imagery to illustrate the new behaviour of Bub as a result from Robert, who was a blind man being in his house. Bub was asked by Robert to explain several things to him, and Bub had to use descriptive words to explain which he was not used to. He realized that he could not just wink or nod at Robert. Instead he had to have an active conversation to talk to Robert normally. Bub’s wife who is an old friend of Robert knew exactly how to talk to direct an old blind man. When Robert arrives to their home, she directs him to the living room saying, “To your left here, Robert. That’s right. Now watch it, there’s a chair. That’s it. Sit down right here. This is the sofa. We just bought this sofa two weeks ago.”(4)This quote from her shows that she is used to using sentences that would describe the physical location and the description of objects. But Bub, who never had a situation like this, had negative feelings about blind people. He found the idea of being blind very upset and weird, which he admitted was based on whatever he saw about blind people in movies. He was indeed bad at explaining what he saw in terms of words to a blind person. When Robert asked him, whether he was religious, Bub just shook his head and instantly realized that Robert can’t see it. Then he replied a ‘no’ and gave the reason. Bub tries his best when he tries to describe cathedrals using words to Robert. He started off describing it with random descriptions, ““To begin with, they’re very tall...They reach way up. Up and up. Toward the sky. They’re so big, some of them, they have to have these supports. To help hold them up, so to speak. These supports are called buttresses. They remind of viaducts, for some reason. But maybe you don’t know viaducts, either? Sometimes the cathedrals have devils and such carved into the front. Sometimes lords and ladies. Don’t ask me why this is,”(11) This description form bub shows that he has no experience describing physical objects completely through words. Bub gives descriptions like ‘tall’, ‘up and up’, ‘big’. But he doesn’t give any basis of which might Robert compare that size to. He also confuses him by saying sometimes devils, and sometimes lords. This would mix up the picture developing in Robert’s head, but Bub had no idea of this. Therefore the author tries to use imagery to show what a hard thing it is to describe vivid physical objects to a blind man.
