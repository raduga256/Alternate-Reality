I have been on the varsity Badminton team since freshman year. I am currently the captain and the lead player of the team. My position has steadily increased- Singles 3 as freshman, Singles 2 as sophomore, and Singles 1 as junior and senior. Since freshman year, it has been my dream to see my team become City champions. I am confident we will be able to make this a reality this season. This is because I have seen the strength and determination of my teammates, their shared ambition to win the championship. Our team's strength is evident by the 10-0 streak we have this season. In the playoffs, we hope to advance well and finally win the championships. Every one of my teammates possesses compassion and eagerness to learn. That is the kind of team I want to be in, it is the reason this is my dream team.
