In “How to Tell a True War Story”, the author Tim O'Brien uses multiple techniques and literary devices to communicate a non-fiction story. However, many parts of his stories are known to be fiction, with vague details and a blurred line between reality and fantasy. When O’Brien says “A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things they have always done….There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil.”, he paints a gloomy picture of the setting in his book, alerting the readers that the dark stories he is about to narrate, are not made up for the purpose of portraying war, but rather to correctly depict it. O’Brien also asserts about the philosophy of a war story when saying, “In many cases a true war story cannot be believed. If you believe it, be skeptical. It’s a question of credibility. Often the crazy stuff is true and the normal stuff isn’t because the normal stuff is necessary to make you believe the truly incredible craziness.” Here, O’Brien is saying that even though the entire story he narrates is true, some more believable untrue parts were added, to make the whole thing seem believable. In this process, he blurs the line between what is fiction and what is not in his book. O’Brien believes war to be one of the few themes which cannot be communicated across normally. One has to manipulate the details, insert emotion and suspense in order to keep the story engaging, otherwise, the story would just be meaningless to tell. O’Brien uses a lot of ambiguity in his book which causes the true parts and the false parts to merge together in a clutter. This ambiguity might come in hand in the personal statement work. I could use it in some sort anecdotes, where if properly used, it will compel the reader to think two or three layers deeper to understand the bigger picture and significance of the story. O’Brien also says, “True war stories do not generalize. They do not indulge in abstraction or analysis” to convey that he is purposely throwing random and miniscule details at the reader to mimic a proper war story. Instead of the author doing all the analysis and reasoning, the readers are expected to put the pieces together in their own way and learn their own moral from the story. Whether the story that O’Brien narrates is true or not, does not matter more than what it teaches. War stories are indeed very difficult to tell. Too much or too little details or events can make the story too vague and meaningless. Therefore, it does not matter if the stories that O’Brien tells are true or not, the lessons are learnt either way.
