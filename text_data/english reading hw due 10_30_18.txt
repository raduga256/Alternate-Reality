Notes: “This was my introduction to an american stranger, kinder than my own parents” pg 156. “Well you are truly on your own now” pg 156. Adeline meets Byron who she finds handsome and is interesting in eating his prepared noodles. Byron shows interest in adeline from day 1 and wants “to have her all to himself for once”. The next day itself, he was teary eyed and confessed love to Adeline. At the end of the page, he wants her to be his wife. She married a guy she spent less than 10 hrs with. He turned out to be a waiter and a lier. Then they went to south california and adeline started an internship and he got an engineer job.
The tone of the author in this part of the book is a flux between happiness and sadness. Adeline is overjoyed with finally realizing her dreams of emigrating to America. When she finds a job in Philadelphia, she was worried that she would not be able to pay for the airline ticket. However, she portrayed this worry as a worthy problem to be tackled by her to achieve her goals. And indeed, the hospital program congratulated her on her position and agreed to deduct monthly installments of the airline ticket’s money from her future paychecks. Adeline received even more joy when the very day after she arrived in New York, she falls in love with the roomate of her roomate, Byron, who in turn is so in love with her, that he becomes teary eyed, and declares that they will be married before the end of the year. Indeed, she married him within six weeks, realizing that she has not even spent more than ten hours with Byron. Alas, Adeline portrays this as an exaggeration as the happiest moment in her life, when all that has been done bad to her all her life, is being repented from the love she is receiving from her newly wedded husband. The readers can see repetition of the daily routine of the couple- waking up, reading Los Angeles Time / The New York Times, eating dinner in silence, both of them reading their books of interest, and Byron watching TV uncontrollably. When her father said, “Well, you are truly on your own now” (Pg. 156), he foreshadowed upon this kind of happening. Byron was not actually an engineer, but a waiter at a restaurant. When Adeline tried to confront him about this reality, the two had an intense marital spat in a filled movie theater. Later on, Adeline paints the picture of their daily routine around the house after the two became increasingly separated from each other, “husband and wife should respect each other like honored guests” (Pg. 163), as Byron wanted them to be. She describes how Byron once almost brought the whole house down with his anger for their marital problems turning into a violent physical rampage that of an animal. This brings us back to how her father hinted on this happening when he said that Adeline is on her own now. He clearly meant to say that she no longer had any parents to come to, let alone parents that cared for her in any way. With her departure from China to emigrate to America, her father and stepmother had essentially broken all ties with her, for her decision to pursue medicine in America, her independence as a woman, was repulsive and defeating to her parents. Although her parents sent her a considerable sum of money as her wedding gift, it might have been a sign of complete break up of ties. The gift might be interpreted as her parents’ way of saying that, “here, take this money and leave us be. We want nothing to do with you”. In conclusion, although Adeline portrays her initial time in the United States as overly enjoyable and filled with happiness, she soon brings it down with the sad reality of her husband being a repressive liar. She is tying these events to the similarity in the beginning of the book.
