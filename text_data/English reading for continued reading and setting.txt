The author of “Falling Leaves”, Adeline Yen Mah, makes use of sensory details and descriptions of her siblings and family members to show her emotions for them. For example, when Adeline says, “I remember him, full of mischief gazing with rapt fascination… to escape.” (Pg. 35), she uses the one moment in which her eldest brother Gregory, supposedly the most favored one of her parents and grandparents, pulls a trick on their grandfather by pulling his nose hair while he was asleep. This incident portrays her disapproval of Gregory, caused also partly by the fact that he would preclude her when playing with their siblings. She uses juxtaposition to compare Gregory’s elderness to his siblings and being childish and mischievous at the same time. Yet, at the same time, Adeline shows deep appreciation for Gregory. She compliments him by saying, “Good with numbers, he occasionally taught us younger ones neat mathematical tricks, roaring with laughter at his own cleverness” (Pg. 35). This conveys the message to the reader that Adeline does not believe Gregory to be full of himself because of him being elder to others, but rather that the duties of their father were unconditionally passed to a young and happy boy. Adeline also appraises Gregory after her grandmother’s demise when saying, “Every few steps, he would fall on his knees and start bewailing the loss of Grandmother at the top of his voice, banging his head repeatedly on the ground to make obeisance… marvelling at his performance.” (Pg. 40). Here, she ensues physical setting of the monks, incense smell, prayer, to place the gloomy mood in which Gregory bravely takes on his father’s duties to mourn for their grandmother by doing the ritual with utmost emotion. Her grandmother’s death traumatized her so much that she even “half hoped and half feared that her grandmother would come out of her coffin during the night and rejoin them in their life”. She was undoubtedly going through an enormous flux of emotions, which she cleverly never states, but shows through using descriptive physical setting and sensory details of her grandmother’s funeral process and juxtaposition about her perceptions of her brother.
        Adeline also recalls the joys of living under her grandmother’s reign in the house. As the eldest one, she refused to join their father’s offer to live in Shanghai due to security reasons, and continued to live in their Tianjin house because to her, “the essence of life was not which city one lived in, but with whom one lived”. Adeline uses intensive sensory details to describe traditional delectable foods that they would eat everyday and their lavish lifestyles, compared to the plain and unnerving life under Niang’s rule in the house. She describes it as serene while saying, “Aunt Baba ran the household and encouraged us children to invite friends home to play and snack on various dim sims in a way Niang would never have tolerated. Mealtimes were informal and the adults talked and played mah-jong late into the evening. Ye Ye kept a skeleton staff in the office….A chauffeur was hired and on Sundays we were driven to various restaurants to try out different cuisines, including Russian, French, and German. I remember drinking hot  chocolate and eating pastries at the sparkling Kiessling Restaurant while a music trio played Strauss waltzes and Beethoven romances. Sometimes we were even taken to see suitable movies.” (Pg. 38). Adeline describes this period of time as heaven. With being allowed to eat all and any amount of her favorite foods that her stepmother would be furious to see, getting to play with her friends at home, not dealing with formal dinners, going to fancy restaurants in which music played while she ate food, and going for movies, Adeline “shows” the serenity of this time. I really liked how she just didn’t list these luxuries after saying her life was serene. That would have drawn out the emotion and the sensory details out of the story. Rather, she took time and effort to go into brief but intense details of each feature of this golden life, essentially bringing the reader into the story to feel how she felt. Moreover, the fact that these things would make Niang excruciatingly furious, made Adeline feel rebellious and as a winner for once. This technique of “showing” and not just “telling”, I think I can use for my essays too. I can effectively show how my teammates and I were going through increasingly more and more confusion and nervousness, as the time for the hackathon to end came to a close and we still did not have a solution. And then how it just hit me like a spark, I can use similes and metaphors here along with describing the scene with intense details, will definitely catch the emotion in the picture. For my essay about my transformative moment at the top of the Grand Canyon, gazing down four thousand feet through a four inch helicopter window, I could use physical setting to describe how much that one single moment meant to me. For it was extremely horrifying, yet so adventurous that my childhood memories came flushing back to me of how I used to climb up trees and park poles. Just how Adeline uses sensory details to describe her relatives, her grandmother’s funeral, and her golden heavenly times when her father and stepmother went to Shanghai while the rest of the family stayed and enjoyed their lives to the fullest in Tianjin, I can employ the same level of physical setting and sensory details to make my essays better by not only saying certain things, but “showing” them with emotion.
