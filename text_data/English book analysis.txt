In the autobiography Falling Leaves, the author, Adeline Yen, gives us a deep look into the life of an unwanted daughter who was shunned by her parents and siblings all her life, but with her sheer determination and the love from her aunt, she achieves her dreams and goes on to become a very successful doctor. Throughout the book, Yen discusses her life as a child living under her tyrannical stepmother Niang. Since all her siblings blame her for their mother’s death, she does not have many people to share her feelings with. When she was young, her grandmother passed away too, leaving Niang in charge of the house, with which power she abused and mistreated the five siblings while over pampering her own children. Towards the end of the book, Yen is now a married adult with two children, working as a professional anesthesiologist. After about thirty one years, she was finally starting to get along with Lydia, her oldest sister, by helping her son out with his education in America. However, when her father dies from alzheimer's disease, and all the children come for the reading of the will, they find out that their father died penniless, “when the young solicitor read out the first page of Father’s will and then announced that there was no money in father’s estate, a collective gasp was audible. We sucked in our breath and looked up at Niang. She calmly glared back at us one by one. Her expression was a combination of triumph and disdain...” (Pg. 236). This was because Niang had taken everything that their father had, his money, his gold, and his properties. As if that wasn’t enough, she ended the recently fixed relationship between Yen and Lydia by manipulating Lydia. This shows in essence the hate that Niang possessed towards all her stepchildren. After two years in her father’s death, Niang gets sick and dies too. When her will is read by James, her favorite stepchild, Yen is astonished to hear that everyone got a share of Niang’s estate except her. Even Lydia, disowned by her parents, received ten percent of Niang’s wealth while Yen, who supported Niang in her surgeries, got nothing. Yen says, “I thought upon my miserable childhood and the abuse Niang had dispensed on those around her. I recalled my elation when I finally escaped from her reign of terror and oppression. And yet it continued to matter to me whether or not she loved me” (Pg 253), to show the deep emotional turmoil she goes under thinking the different possibilities in her head from the first point since meeting Niang to her death that whether or not they departed on good terms, whether she loved her or not. This portrays the longingness of love that Yen has, her trying to fill that void desperately by attempting to amend her terms with her siblings and Niang. It is evident throughout the book that in these attempts, Yen sometimes get misguided. For example, as it turns out, the real reason why Niang suddenly insisted to coming to America to get operated for her cancer after denying Yen’s offer for months, was that if and when she dies in America, the US government would have imposed death duties on Yen’s estate. She is heartbroken from this revelation, further adding on to Niang’s evil portrayal as a hateful being capable of showing no sympathy towards her stepchildren. When Yen and her husband Bob tried to find her father’s will in Niang’s apartment, they found another such heartbreaking revelation. Even when Lydia was disowned by father, she kept a secret conversation with Niang going on, writing to her almost everyday, planting poisonous stories about Yen’s betrayal to Niang when she helped her sister Susan and that Yen was trying to take over control from Niang. To see her own blood and flesh turn on her like that, Yen was shocked and taken aback, wondering whether she is the only one capable of love in her family. This crossroad in Yen’s life depicts her as a compassionate person as she did not sue James in the court even though there was a share that she found her father left for her in his will. Yen says “whatever happens, this, my father’s will, is what is important to me. He at least did not exclude me” (Pg 267) which shows her closure with her turmoil with her parents’ love for her. Upon reading her father’s will, she finally got a last glimpse of one of her most cherished things in the world, her father’s love for her, which she had not seen ever since Niang stepped into their house. One important literary device that occurs throughout the book is the repetition of the phrase, “Suan le!” by James. James says this phrase, meaning “Let it be!”, repeatedly to Yen exclusively throughout the book, sometimes to calm her, other times to calm himself. Its earliest appearance happened when Yen’s pet duckling PLT was killed by Jackie the dog. James consoled Yen to possibly prevent her from taking a harsh action by using this phrase. He uses it again towards the end of the book to try to make Yen drop the case of Niang’s will. Evidently, this use of language proves to effective everytime. Even at the end, when the topic of issue is the matter of inherited wealth, James’s “Suan le!” causes Yen to drop this pursuit as she says, “Sang ge! (Third Elder brother)! It was a great misfortune for us to have had Niang for a stepmother. Don’t worry, I won’t contest her will. I will never allow her to triumph over me.” (Pg 270). In the last chapter of the book, Yen visits her aunt Baba, a very influential and important person in her life, especially in her childhood. When Yen offered aunt Baba to come to America for treatment for her colon cancer, she nonchalantly denied saying “I have had a good run of eighty-nine years. It is time to accept the end. Since there is no hope of a cure, why prolong the agony of dying?” (Pg 272). Hearing this, Yen had a feeling of untethered weightlessness. She understood the deeper meaning of aunt Baba’s decision, that there is no point in pondering over past events, over things that an individual cannot do anything about anymore. A person should be able to live free and clear of any tensions. Yen had been living in fear of Niang and longing of acceptance from her all her life. But after remembering the story aunt Baba used to tell her as a child, she finally found peace with her past. The author uses pathos heavily in the text to reach and connect with the audience on the human level. Although her stories are naturally sad and very unfortunate, her use of word choice and juxtaposition of continuous unfortunate events gives her main idea an emotional depth. By employing this technique, Yen is able to give the readers a sense of what things looked like from her perspective in the specific times. I plan to use this technique in my fiction writing later this year as it proves to be very effective to carry the main idea to the reader in the literal as well as the emotional aspect. I personally enjoyed this book very much. Reading and learning about Yen’s life in China and then her dedicated journey to America and to becoming a doctor is very inspiring and relatable. Since I myself have come from India here, I know firsthand the difficulties an immigrant might face socially here. But just like Yen proves through her story, with determination comes success.
