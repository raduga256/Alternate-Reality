Ramansh Sharma                        Opinion Editorial                                  Date-3/5/18

It was a regular night doing my homework when the news on New York Times hit me like rock. Nineteen year old Nikolas Cruz, a former student of the Parkland high school, barged in the school building and used a semi automatic AR-15 rifle. Seventeen students died. 
        But there lies beneath a bigger problem. People are growing ignorant of these shootings. For most people, such news is another daily surprise, which after “expressing condolences” through a tweet or two, is forgotten. A New York Times article put it, “Gunfire ringing out in American schools used to be rare, and shocking. Now it seems to happen all the time…..We have absolutely become numb to these kinds of shootings” [1]. Although most people in America claim to be strongly against gun violence, few actually speak out against it. 
        Moreover, another issue is the ease at which a person can legally obtain a firearm in most states. Not only that, a BBC article states, “The right to own guns is regarded by many as enshrined in the Second Amendment to the US Constitution” [2]. In my opinion, it is threatening to the American society. Regular citizens do not need guns for their protection. The only thing regular people might need to carry guns for is to protect themselves against shooters, who in turn again can obtain a gun easily. This could be prevented if the second amendment was not “fiercely defended by groups such as the National Rifle Association” [3]. An organization legally providing guns to people is what gives the shooters motive to wreak havoc. According to the same article, 60% of all American homicides are with guns, which portrays how serious the issue of firearm availability is.
        But there is hope. After the recent Florida high school shooting, numerous adults and children have set out to make a change. According to polls by Huffington Post, 60 percent of Americans currently believe gun violence is a very serious problem facing the country, up from 53 percent last November [4]. In another poll, more than 50 percent of all age groups believe that gun violence can be stopped. The students from the high school even marched up to White House and demanded for stricter gun control laws. These students were the ones to face the tragedy, and realize in truth the depth of this issue. In an interview from CNN of Cameron Kasky, a survivor of the shooting, Kasky said words that truly show what “our generation” wants - We can't ignore the issues of gun control that this tragedy raises. And so, I'm asking--no, demanding--we take action now [5].
        All Americans are part of a shared web, a shared identity. Walt Whitman encapsulated this idea in his Song of Myself when he said, “And what I assume you shall assume. For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you”. Through this he is trying to convey the idea that everyone in a shared community is the same organism. One big body. One big mind. Therefore, everyone needs to take gun violence seriously because this affect them. In the Boston Massacre, the soldiers opened fire into the public. Even though only a few died, the event became immortal and crucially important to history. In our time, even when scores of people die in a shooting, the news is only….news.
There’s no cowardice or shame in speaking out against gun violence. As Bronx Science students, we do not want any tragedy like this upon us. For that, we all need to make effort and support for stricter gun laws because we decide our own future. And to make the change, we have to be the change. Set an example. Be the city upon a hill.
