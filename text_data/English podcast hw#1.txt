The “Return to the Scene of the Crime” podcast was very interesting and engaging in a unique way. This podcast, being the first one I have ever listened to, left a long lasting impression on me. To me, it was like a classic play. Starting with a prologue, having three “acts” in it, it was extremely enjoyable. Of the four parts the podcast had, my favorite one was Act 2- “D-u-why?!” by Mike Birbiglia. It was interesting to me because of the unusual yet intriguing plot. Mike happened to be in a car accident when his car collided with a drunk man’s car. The plot had small special moments that made the audience laugh and take such an unfortunate event in an amusing way. I believe this to be a very prominent feature of podcasts. They put a fun and casual twist to taboo and mostly sad events. Whether it be about a teenage girl shoplifting and being punished by holding a sign saying she shoplifted in front of the store, a dangerous car accident for which the victim paid $12,000 to compensate for the other man’s car even when it was not his fault, or a young man’s story about coming out to his mother who was the only one to support him, but unfortunately dies very soon. Maybe it was because we were not seeing the tears in the eyes of the speakers, it was like reading a book, only with more guidance towards as to what the emotions are supposed to be associated with a certain event in the story. In Act 2, Mike recalls the police officer who helped him up, asking him to sign a piece of paper that said that Mike was fine, so that the police can leave. When Mike insisted that he needed medical attention and that he was not fine, the officer forced him to sign in by pushing the paper on his face. Later on, Mike was asked by the car insurance company of the other person in the accident, to compensate for the damage he did to the car. Since Mike was the victim, not the culprit in the accident, he asked to see the police report to understand why this misconception was occurring, and was surprised to find that the officer did a lousy job making the report, which confused him and the other person interchangeably, causing the report to make Mike seem at fault. Even his efforts to reason with the police department captain were in vain, as the captain kept insisting to Mike that, “he do the right thing”. Infuriated, Mike began preparing legal measures, PI’s, and lawyers, to sue the police department and the other guy in the accident to get justice. Eventually, his girlfriend asked him to let go and be thankful that he is still alive, which changed his heart and he paid the sum of money to the insurance company. All this, Mike talked in such a casual way that this accident seemed like a jolly life learning lesson whereas he, first hand experienced a great amount of anger from it. Realizing this, and still enjoying the act, it really moved me to see the power of a podcast, to be able to turn this sad event into a happy one. It’s as if people like to talk about these taboo and cliché things in front of an audience. I still do not know if they have to prepare their speech beforehand to be so influential and enjoyable, but nonetheless, they speak magic. The theme of this podcast was “Returning to the Scene of the Crime” which was captured by the prologue along with all the acts. The prologue was an interesting piece too. A judge in a small town in the South, sends shoplifters to hold a sign saying they shoplifted in front of the very store they did it from. While greatly humiliating and a topic of human rights, the creators gave an amusing twist to this piece too. The speaker talked about a mother whose son was holding the sign, and was having fun doing it. He was laughing and posing with the sign in front of his relatives taking pictures, who were also laughing. So in conclusion, these events, all tragic and pessimistic at first, are portrayed as a positive and fun thing. Maybe, it is another feature of podcasts, to look at the bright side of such things.
