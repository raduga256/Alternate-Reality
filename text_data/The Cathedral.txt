In the short story, The Cathedral, the author Raymond Carver, uses imagery to illustrate the new behaviour of Bub as a result from Robert, who was a blind man being in his house. Bub was asked by Robert to explain several things to him, and Bub had to use descriptive words to explain which he was not used to. He realized that he could not just wink or nod at Robert. Instead he had to have an active conversation to talk to Robert normally. Bub’s wife who is an old friend of Robert knew exactly how to talk to direct an old blind man. When Robert arrives to their home, she directs him to the living room saying, “To your left here, Robert. That’s right. Now watch it, there’s a chair. That’s it. Sit down right here. This is the sofa. We just bought this sofa two weeks ago.”(4)This quote from her shows that she is used to using sentences that would describe the physical location and the description of objects. But Bub, who never had a situation like this, had negative feelings about blind people. He found the idea of being blind very upset and weird, which he admitted was based on whatever he saw about blind people in movies. He was indeed bad at explaining what he saw in terms of words to a blind person. When Robert asked him, whether he was religious, Bub just shook his head and instantly realized that Robert can’t see it. Then he replied a ‘no’ and gave the reason. Bub tries his best when he tries to describe cathedrals using words to Robert. He started off describing it with random descriptions, ““To begin with, they’re very tall...They reach way up. Up and up. Toward the sky. They’re so big, some of them, they have to have these supports. To help hold them up, so to speak. These supports are called buttresses. They remind of viaducts, for some reason. But maybe you don’t know viaducts, either? Sometimes the cathedrals have devils and such carved into the front. Sometimes lords and ladies. Don’t ask me why this is,”(11) This description form bub shows that he has no experience describing physical objects completely through words. Bub gives descriptions like ‘tall’, ‘up and up’, ‘big’. But he doesn’t give any basis of which might Robert compare that size to. He also confuses him by saying sometimes devils, and sometimes lords. This would mix up the picture developing in Robert’s head, but Bub had no idea of this. Therefore the author tries to use imagery to show what a hard thing it is to describe vivid physical objects to a blind man.
